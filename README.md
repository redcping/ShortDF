We introduce the Shortest Path Diffusion Model (ShortDF), a denoising diffusion model based on shortest-path modeling, which optimizes residual propagation to minimize reconstruction error and enhance denoising efficiency and sample quality. By optimizing the initial residuals, ShortDF significantly reduces diffusion time (or steps) and improves the visual fidelity of generated samples, making it a powerful tool for interactive diffusion-based applications and rapid data generation
